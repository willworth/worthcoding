## Show your work!

I'm going to post as much as I can here to document my coding, as showing understanding consolidates it, and it's a nice reference for me for the future.

Some of these will be *really* basic, but the plan is to just stick it all here without worrying too much about impressing anyone with the sophistication.  That said, as I improve
I plan to come back and edit with "how I would do it these days".  I'm always learning, so please get in touch with any tips.

Initially, I'm going to use [edabit](https://edabit.com/user/kkahSiwvuQkvaFnFq) and [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/willworth).  These are links to my profiles.

Long ago, I ran a marathon, and later had a friend who trained to do the same by BOUNCING ON A TRAMPOLINE.  Predictably, when the day of the marathon rolled around, she was... not prepared to run 40km.  I'm doing my best to avoid the same mistake by coding actual problems daily, rather than just living in [tutorial purgatory](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-escape-tutorial-purgatory-as-a-new-developer-or-at-any-time-in-your-career-e3a4b2384a40).
