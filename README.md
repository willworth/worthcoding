Hi!
This is my personal coding site.  You are free to copy things, and even ask me for help if you get stuck!   :ok_hand:
## I have learnt a lot from clear, beginner-friendly readme files, so I aim to provide the same here. ##

This site(blog) is a fork of one of the official [Gatsby starters](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).  [Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator for react.  I am hosting my site on Amazon Web Services as I want to learn to use AWS well, but there are simpler options- notably netlify, surge.sh and even github pages.

## prerequisites
node

gatsby cli


- clone repo then within same directory as the package.json run
- npm i
- then (assuming gatsby cli is installed)
gatsby develop




Currently deploying to s3 using aws "amplify "
